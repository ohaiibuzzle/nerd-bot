# NERDBOT ðŸ¤–

## What is it??

A fun and friendly discord bot programmed by me [amazinglySK](www.github.com/amzinglySK). Its a simple bot made using the discord.py module used to make discord bots.. It is a friendly bot to hangout with and its development is under process. We hope that this project turn out to be a success and will be very fun to interact.

## About this code.

**Note**: - I am very much new to python development and this is my first big project. The codebase might not be professional but I have given my best shot.

The code is organised into different files. Each file contains different classes and the filename matches the function they do for almost all of them.

- nerd.py : - Main worker file. May contain essential miscellanous code.
- dataman.py : - Manages json data manipulation and reading data from it.
- embeds.py : - Consists of the code for all embeds used in the bot
- errors.py : - Error checks to give an appropriate response to the user

data and .env examples are given in the repo for reference.
